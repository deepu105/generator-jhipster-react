## Installation

**Attention: This is still a work in progress. Use the below steps to use the unreleased development version**

TODO:

- Migrate Account modules
- Migrate Admin modules
- support no i18n properly
- support no-sass option
- Add entity sub generator
- Add import-jdl sub generator
- Migrate protractor tests
- Add generator tests
- Add generator travis builds

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/), then install generator-jhipster-react using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-jhipster
```

Clone [JHipster](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster) and run `npm link` inside it.

Clone this project and run `npm link` and `npm link generator-jhipster` inside it.

Now all the projects are pointing to latest master versions

Now generate your new awesome project:

```bash
yo jhipster-react
```

Make sure to run `npm link generator-jhipster-react` within the generated project if you are regenerating it again.

As this is a generator which runs on top of [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/), we expect you have [JHipster and its related tools already installed](http://jhipster.github.io/installation.html).

This generator requires Jhipster version 4.1 or greater in order to work

## Development-mode

Frontend is working through [webpack-dev-server](webpack-dev-server-url) proxy mode feature in order to have an ability to use both frontend & backend server simultaneously. All requests from frontend would be proxied to backend server.

To start frontend server please run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```
